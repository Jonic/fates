## Fates 1.8+ BOM - Thru Hole Only (for those with a pre-smd-soldered pcb)

Some parts are listed with a zero quantity. This are meant to be alternates (and should be marked with `ALT`). Choose what works best for you.

Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4B can be purchased from a number of sources such as [PiShop.us](https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-1gb/), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775?src=raspberrypi), [CanaKit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus.html?cid=usd&src=raspberrypi&src=raspberrypi), [Element14](http://www.newark.com/49AC7637?src=raspberrypi), etc.
Mouser also now carries Pis (although a bit more expensive) if you want one-stop shopping (part numbers listed below).

ENC4 is optional and is not functional for norns right now. If you want to use Orac later, get 4 encoders.

You might need to adjust order quantities, get knurled encoders, or get clicky buttons instead of quiet. So be sure to check part numbers and availability before ordering. NOTE - some parts may be out of stock. See the alternates listed above for other choices.

**[A mouser cart](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=c39648324f )** is setup with these parts (not including Pi). 

Spacers/screws are also not included in this cart. There is a [separate cart for spacers](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=367d290c06) if you need them (**Cart does not include screws**).


**NOTE - If you're getting an acrylic case from the Denki-oto shop, the case kit includes spacers/screws.**

Spacers/screws - I use 2.5mm size screws and spacers. 3mm should work as well.

Here's my spacer list. This may also be to taste if you solder the display header closer to the main board. Sorry I don't have a good Mouser part number for 2.5M screws.
